# NodeSailor

NodeSailor is a basic network topology mapping, configuration and testing tool.  

I know next to nothing about network configuration or Python - this tool begun as a project created in order to better understand a unique network installation, and at the same time, learn how to write some Python.

It has largely been written copy/pasting ChatGPT prompts!    


**Installation**

A prepackaged executable can be found in the releases section - https://github.com/wufle/NodeSailor/releases

If you would like to run the project froun the source, clone the repository and run the command

`pip install -r requirements.txt`


**Known bugs/problems:**
- Pan and zoom funcitonality messes with the alignment of cursor and nodes

**Future plans:**
* Colour scheme options
* Ping only selected networks/vlans
* New network create to open prompt to set network names
* User created background image for networks
* Codebase cleanup
* Make the help page pretty
* Node/cable list with search functionality
