# NodeSailor

NodeSailor is a basic network topology mapping, configuration and testing tool.  

I know next to nothing about network configuration or Python - this tool begun as a project created in order to better understand a unique network installation, and at the same time, learn how to write some Python.

It has largely been written copy/pasting ChatGPT prompts!
